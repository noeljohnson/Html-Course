    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>
      This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. 
      In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water 
      bath that is <b>precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.</b> 
      In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter</cite> describes it as 
      <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with <i>Dill Hollandaise</i>. To reserve a 
      seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2016-11-30">November 30</time>.
